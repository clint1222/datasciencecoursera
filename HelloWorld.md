## This is a markdown file

Anyone who stumbles upon this repository and is looking at a markdown file with one line saying "This is a markdown file", is probably thinking to themselves, "Thanks, genius." and flipping the *bozo bit*.

So an explanation is probably in order.  A markdown file named **HelloWorld.md** with the single line of text is the third requirement for a coursera course project.  Specifically, the May 2015 running of [The Data Scientist's Toolbox][DataSciToolbox].

Most likely though, if you are reading this you already know that.  For you I'm just experimenting with some markdown features and pushing an update to github.  Enjoy the rest of the course.
